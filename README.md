# Touchdown

This project was a simple exercise in coding with SwiftUI. It does not function as a complete app.

Making the transition from UIKit to SwiftUI, so I wanted to get some real coding in.

The assets and design of the app was from Nick Sarno through one of his courses online.
Everything works as the original developer intended.
